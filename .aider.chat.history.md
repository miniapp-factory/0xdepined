#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Track every DEPIN  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve three files:

1. `mini-app/lib/farcaster-embed.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values used in the Farcaster embed metadata.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or update the logo‑generation todo file so a new logo image will be produced.  
3. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the exported `title` and `description` constants that are used throughout the app (e.g., in the share component and the home page).

Please add these three files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.

The changes you need to make involve three files:

####   
#### DePIN Hub is a unified platform that brings together every major Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) project in the ecosystem. The app provides clear project overviews, real-time data, token details, roadmap insights, and direct access links to official websites, dashboards, and documentation.

The files that will most likely need to be edited to satisfy the requests you’ve made are:

```
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
mini-app/components/depins-list.tsx
mini-app/app/page.tsx
mini-app/lib/farcaster-embed.ts
```

These are the only files that will need changes; the rest of the repository contains context or read‑only files. Let me know which of these you’d like to add to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
